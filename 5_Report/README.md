# Abstract

This mini project is based on the Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System. It is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats using ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Switches, Heat generator,and LCD display,etc.

# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION

The case study includes Seat Heating systems for cars.An automotive seat heater is an electronic device that falls under the category of automotive interior comfort products. A seat heater is a pad or a cushion that encompasses an electric heating system which boosts up surface temperature of the automotive seat at the will of the person who sits on it.As with the lights in your car, the heated seats are controlled by a type of switch called a relay. A relay allows a small electric current to control a much larger one.

When you flip the switch to turn on the seat heater, a small current flows through a coil in the relay. Near this coil is an open switch. When current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field, which pulls the switch closed. This completes a circuit, sending electricity from the battery to the seat cushion heating element. The audible click you can hear in some cars when you turn on the seat heater is the relay closing.

## RESEARCH

AS the Technology goes on developing,many comfort zones are been adding to the humans life.In automobile development ,improving its featuresin order to preside the drivers comforts is being one of the main intention of the manufactures.Along with the car cooling system ,seat heaters is also one of those ideas.In Arctic regions and cold regions where atmospheric temperature is less than zero degrees,this seat heaters are most useful.In order increase the temperature of the persons who sits in the car,accroding to his wish,may useful for the people living those regions.

## DEFINING OUR SYSTEM

Our system is all about to adjust the temperature of seat in the car according to desire of driver.It first checks the presence of the passenger on seat ,then it allows the driver to change the temperature of the seat according to his desire.And temperature is displayed on Hd44780-25 display ,by that the driver can change temperature by changing the knob of the heater adjustment.

# STATE OF ART

## COST

### Manufacturer side:
•	Production cost depends upon total cost of the components.
•	installation cost.
•	It also includes profit for the manufacturer.
•	Wages for developers working on the development of worker.
### customer side:
•	It will little amount of cost for running the product.
• It will include small percentage in the cost of car.
•	It case of damage it includes cost for reinstalling according to the failure of component.
•	It has maintenance cost.

# FEATURES
•	It has most efficient operation.
•	Quick response.
•	It has less cost for maintenance.
•	It has wide range temperatures.
•	It is easy for customer to  operate.
•	It has less risk for fire accident and less chance of failure.

## ELECTRICAL CALCULATIONS INCLUDE
 Calculations include calculating the resolution of potentiometer according to supply voltage and providing the different temperature for each voltage.
## 4W and 1H

### Who:
The system is useful for the people who lives in the arctic regions and cold regions. 
### What:
The objective of the project is to develop an system which is useful for a person who drives the car in exterme cold conditions.

### Where:
It can be used in every domestic /commercial vehicles ,which travels in arctic region and extreme cold conditions .

### When:
In cold weather conditions.
### How:
It is a system which can simply installed in a car,in order to maintain the temperature of the seat in the car.
